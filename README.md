LocalNet is a self-sustaining, decentralized network that works entirely without a traditional internet connection.  
It behaves like an app – with a start page, navigation, and page management.  
Technically, however, it’s not a classic app-store program, but a locally hosted, shareable network system that grows with every connected device.  
It enables people to create, discover, and share web pages locally – without any central servers, ads, or accounts.  
📦 You get LocalNet as a ZIP file – via QR code, Bluetooth, USB stick, or other peer-to-peer methods.  
Once unzipped, you can open it directly – on your phone, laptop, or even a small mini-computer. Everything runs completely offline.  


## 🚀 What is LocalNet?

LocalNet is a shareable system for digital content.  
It’s based on locally stored data and a synchronizable index that grows automatically as users add new pages.  
You can:  
• 🌱 Create your own pages – via drag & drop, code, or templates  
• 🔍 Discover other pages – thematically, regionally, or globally  
• 🔄 Sync automatically – every time you open your app  
• 📴 Work offline – fully independent from the internet  


## 📱 Platform Compatibility

LocalNet works on all modern devices – without any app store, account, or internet connection.  
You can get the app in the following ways:

✅ **Via QR code**  
– Scan the code and download the ZIP file  
– After unzipping, you instantly access the app interface  
– Works on Android, iOS, tablets, mini-computers  

✅ **Via peer-to-peer transfer**  
– e.g. through Bluetooth, AirDrop, USB stick, or memory card  
– The ZIP file is manually transferred and opened locally  

✅ **Via download (e.g. from GitHub or local pages)**  
– You download the ZIP via browser  
– After unzipping, you can launch LocalNet as a local app  
– Works on Windows, macOS, Linux – no installation, no setup needed  

Once opened, LocalNet runs locally – with its own interface and offline network.  
No app stores. No registration. No internet required.  


## 📦 How does it work?

**1️⃣ Start Page with Search**  
Upon launch, you see the LocalNet homepage. You can filter pages by topic, language, or region.  

**2️⃣ Create Pages Locally**  
You can build your own content using:  
– 🧱 Drag-and-drop  
– 💻 HTML/CSS/JS  
– 📜 Templates (e.g. for health, education, projects)  

**3️⃣ Local Security Check**  
Each created page is automatically checked for:  
– Dangerous functions  
– External connections  
– Tracking-like or disruptive processes  
➜ This keeps your device safe.  

**4️⃣ Sync on App Start**  
Every time you launch the app, LocalNet synchronizes its global index with other devices – offline and peer-based:  
– New pages are detected  
– Deleted pages are removed  
– Page contents are loaded only on click (“on demand”)  

**5️⃣ Distributed Growth via Tree Structure**  
All devices store small parts of the network. When they meet (e.g. via QR, USB, or Bluetooth), they exchange new pages automatically.  
The system grows – page by page, device by device.  


## 🧠 Technical Concept

• Every page is hosted locally on the device it was created on  
• A distributed pages_index.json stores page titles, languages, categories, etc.  
• Content is stored modular, compressed, and anonymized  
• No device holds “everything” – each instance contributes a piece  
• Sync is entirely offline and automatic at each launch  


## 📊 Storage & Scaling

The initial version of LocalNet is limited to ~3–4 GB, which allows for:  
• 🗂️ 5–10 million entries in the page index (< 100 MB)  
• 📝 500–1000 active contents at once  
• 🔄 Compressed content (~20–50 KB per page)  
• ➕ Extensions (e.g. archive devices, knowledge modules) possible later  

**Result:** Even the base version can manage and sync over 100,000 pages.  


## 📁 File Sizes & Media Content

LocalNet is optimized for lightweight content – ideal for text, images, and structured knowledge.  
To ensure smooth usage even on low-spec devices, the following limits apply:  
• 📄 Text pages should stay under 500 KB – enough for several thousand words  
• 🖼️ Images should be kept below 200 KB per file – large images should be resized or optimized beforehand  
• 🧳 Complete page bundles (text + images) should remain under 1 MB  
• 🎥 Video and audio content are currently not supported, but planned for future versions  
• 📚 Larger works like books, serialized articles, or archives can be added – as long as they are in plain text format  

🎯 Our goal: Make all content usable offline – even on limited devices.  
💡 The system architecture is already designed to support larger media formats later on – through optional modules or archive add-ons.  


## 🔐 Security & Content

🧪 **Local Code Verification**  
When creating your own pages, LocalNet checks for:  
• External connections  
• Attempts to access system functions  
• Embedded tracking scripts  
Only clean, safe code is accepted.  

🤝 **Trust & Reporting System**  
Freedom requires responsibility.  
• Pages can be reported – e.g. for questionable or inappropriate content  
• Reports must include a reason (e.g. incitement to violence, dangerous misinformation)  
• Reported pages are temporarily hidden until reviewed  
• An optional “Safe Mode” shows only verified content or warns about edge cases (e.g. opinion, satire)  

⚠️ The goal is not censorship – but protection from harm, while staying open to critical, creative, and independent content.  


## 🔄 Sharing & Distribution

**The app itself:**  
• Fully shareable via QR code, ZIP, USB, Bluetooth, or AirDrop  
• No app store, no download link, no cloud required  

**Content & Index:**  
• Anyone uploading a page stores it locally  
• Other devices pick it up automatically when the app starts  
• The global index updates every time the app is opened  

No login needed – just devices running LocalNet.  


## ⚖️ Core Values & Purpose

LocalNet is built on these principles:  
• 🕊️ Freedom – Anyone can participate, no registration needed  
• 🔒 Privacy – No trackers, no servers, no ads  
• 🧠 Responsibility – Critical content, yes – but no hate or harm  
• 🧩 Connection over isolation – Share & discover content on your terms  
• 🌍 Knowledge & community – Built around people, not control  


## 🌱 Why LocalNet?

Because we want to decide for ourselves again:  
• What we read  
• What we share  
• What we connect with  

No internet requirement. No subscriptions. No central control.  
LocalNet is a tool for true digital self-determination:  
📲 Local, 🔐 secure, 🤝 independent.  
Host a page.  
Open your app.  
And connect with the world – without the internet.
